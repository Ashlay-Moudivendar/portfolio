## Prototype

Prototype in Figma: [https://www.figma.com/proto/1LtbjIRtHfcXcivCoiDtk6/Portfolio?node-id=28-2&p=f&t=aAOJB8qAMy3xRydo-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=28%3A2](https://www.figma.com/proto/1LtbjIRtHfcXcivCoiDtk6/Portfolio?node-id=28-2&p=f&t=aAOJB8qAMy3xRydo-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=28%3A2)

## Technologies

I have opted for Vanilla JS, along with HTML and CSS. This version is lightweight and does not require interactivity, so there is no need to use React (it would be overkill).
Additionally, for now, there is no API or database involved.

For version control and deployment, I have used GitHub and Vercel.

## What I learned ?

1. Integration of Google fonts
2. Benefits of using *rem* (or *em*) instead of *px*
3. Setup a fixed header
4. Gradient color for backgrounds, borders and texts
5. Variables in CSS
6. Create shapes with *border* attribute
7. Web components without component-based frameworks
8. Good practices for accessibility
9. CSS Parent selector
10. Use offset in case header is fixed
11. Carousel
12. *SetInterval* function
